        <h2>Chole Bhature</h2>
        <p>Chole Bhature is a beloved North Indian dish that consists of spicy chickpea curry (chole) served with deep-fried bread (bhature). 
            The chickpeas are cooked in a flavorful blend of onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. 
            The curry is rich, tangy, and has a slight heat, making it a perfect companion to the fluffy and crispy bhature. 
            The bhature is made from a fermented dough of all-purpose flour, yogurt, and a pinch of baking powder. 
            It is then rolled out into a round shape and deep-fried until it puffs up and turns golden brown. 
            Chole Bhature is often served with pickles, yogurt, and a side of sliced onions.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a pressure cooker or large pot, add soaked and drained chickpeas along with enough water to cover them. 
                Cook until the chickpeas are tender (around 4-5 whistles in a pressure cooker).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes, green chilies, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. 
                Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the spices are well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chickpeas (along with the water) to the pan. Mix well and bring it to a simmer. 
                Cook for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle garam masala over the chole and mix well. Cook for an additional 2 minutes. Adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish the Chole with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>For Bhature(Fried Bread)</h4>

            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, plain yogurt, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add water gradually and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small lemon-sized portions. Roll each portion into a round shape, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai over medium-high heat for deep frying.</li>
            <li>Carefully slide the rolled dough into the hot oil and fry until it puffs up and turns golden brown on both sides. 
                Flip it once to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried bhatura from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain the excess oil on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Serve the hot and fluffy Bhature with the prepared Chole. It is traditionally enjoyed with pickles, sliced onions, and a side of yogurt.</li>
