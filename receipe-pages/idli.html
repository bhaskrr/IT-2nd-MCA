        <h2>Idli</h2>
        <p>Idli is a quintessential South Indian delicacy that delights food enthusiasts with its lightness and delicate flavors. 
            Made from a batter consisting of rice and split black lentils (urad dal), 
            the preparation involves soaking and grinding the ingredients before fermenting the batter overnight. 
            The fermented batter is then poured into idli molds and steamed to perfection, resulting in soft and spongy cakes.
            Idlis are enjoyed as a versatile dish, typically served for breakfast or as a snack. 
            They are often paired with an assortment of accompaniments, such as coconut chutney, 
            sambar (lentil-based vegetable stew), and tomato chutney. </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul type="none">
                <li>- 2 cups idli rice (parboiled rice)</li>
                <li>- 1 cup urad dal (split black lentils)</li>
                <li>- 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
                <li>- Salt to taste</li>
                <li>- Water for soaking and grinding</li>

            </ul>

            
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the idli rice and urad dal separately a few times under cold water. 
                Soak them in water in separate bowls for at least 4 hours. 
                If using fenugreek seeds, soak them along with the urad dal.</li>
            <li>Drain the water from both the rice and urad dal. 
                Transfer the urad dal to a blender or wet grinder and blend it with some water until it becomes a smooth and fluffy batter. 
                The consistency should be thick and airy.</li>
            <li>Transfer the urad dal batter to a large bowl. Next, grind the soaked idli rice with water until it becomes a smooth paste. 
                The consistency should be slightly grainy but not too coarse.</li>
            <li>Mix the idli rice batter with the urad dal batter in the same large bowl. Add salt to taste and mix well using your hands. 
                The combination of the two batters should be well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let the batter ferment in a warm place for about 8-10 hours or overnight. 
                The fermentation process is crucial for soft and fluffy idlis.</li>
            <li>Once the batter has fermented, it will rise and become frothy. Give it a gentle stir. 
                If the batter seems too thick, you can add a little water to adjust the consistency.</li>
            <li>Grease the idli molds with a little oil or ghee. Pour the batter into each mold, filling them about three-fourths full. 
                Place the idli stand in a steamer or large pot with water and steam the idlis for about 10-12 minutes on medium heat, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Once the idlis are cooked, remove them from the molds using a spoon or a flat spatula. 
                Serve the hot and fluffy idlis with coconut chutney, sambar, or your favorite accompaniments.</li>
        </ol>
           <p>Enjoy the homemade idlis, and adjust the fermentation time based on the temperature and climate in your area. 
            The idli batter can be refrigerated and used for up to 2-3 days.
