        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul type="none">
                <li>- 2 cups basmati rice</li>
                <li>- 500 grams chicken pieces (bone-in or boneless)</li>
                <li>- 1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>- 2 tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
                <li>- 2 tablespoons biryani masala (readily available or make your own with a blend of spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaf)</li>
                <li>- 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
                <li>- 1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>- 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
                <li>- 1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves</li>
                <li>- 2 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
                <li>- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
                <li>- 2 cups water</li>
                <li>- Salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter. Then, add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste to the pan and cook for a minute until fragrant. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are lightly browned on all sides.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy. Add the biryani masala and salt, and cook for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth. Add the yogurt, chopped mint leaves, and chopped coriander leaves to the chicken mixture. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly with the spices and yogurt.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the pot. Gently mix the rice with the chicken and spices, ensuring the rice is well coated.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the chicken is tender.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice gently with a fork. Serve the Chicken Biryani hot, garnished with additional mint leaves and fried onions if desired.</li>
        </ol>

`       <p>Chicken Biryani is a complete meal on its own, but it can be accompanied by raita (yogurt-based side dish) and salad for a refreshing contrast. 
            Enjoy this aromatic and flavorful Chicken Biryani with family and friends!
