        <h2>Jadoh</h2>
        <p>Jadoh is a traditional rice dish from the northeastern state of Meghalaya, India. 
            It is a flavorful and hearty preparation that combines rice with meat, usually pork, along with a blend of aromatic spices. 
            The rice is cooked with the meat, onions, ginger, garlic, and a variety of local spices, resulting in a dish that is rich in flavors and textures. 
            The meat imparts its savory essence to the rice, creating a delightful combination. 
            Jadoh is known for its comforting taste and is often enjoyed as a main course or during festive occasions.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul type="none">
                <li>- 1 cup basmati rice</li>
                <li>- 250 grams boneless chicken or pork, cut into small pieces (you can also use smoked pork for an authentic flavor)</li>
                <li>- 1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>- 2 tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
                <li>- 2 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
                <li>- 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
                <li>- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                <li>- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>- Salt to taste</li>
                <li>- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish (optional)</li>

            </ul>

            
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pan or pressure cooker over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies to the pan. Cook for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken or pork pieces to the pan and cook until they are lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in the turmeric powder, ground black pepper, and salt. Mix well to coat the meat with the spices.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked basmati rice to the pan. Stir gently to mix the rice with the meat and spices.</li>
            <li>Pour in enough water to cook the rice (the ratio of rice to water is usually 1:2). Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. </li>

            <li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. 
                If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 2-3 whistles.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, fluff the rice gently with a fork. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve hot Jadoh as a main course or as a part of a meal. It pairs well with a side of raita (yogurt-based side dish) or pickle.</li>
        </ol>
