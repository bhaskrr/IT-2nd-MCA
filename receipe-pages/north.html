                <h2>Chole Bhature</h2>
                <p>Chole Bhature is a beloved North Indian dish that consists of spicy chickpea curry (chole) served with deep-fried bread (bhature). 
                    The chickpeas are cooked in a flavorful blend of onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. 
                    The curry is rich, tangy, and has a slight heat, making it a perfect companion to the fluffy and crispy bhature. 
                    The bhature is made from a fermented dough of all-purpose flour, yogurt, and a pinch of baking powder. 
                    It is then rolled out into a round shape and deep-fried until it puffs up and turns golden brown. 
                    Chole Bhature is often served with pickles, yogurt, and a side of sliced onions.</p>

                <h2>Dal Makhani</h2>
                <p>Dal Makhani is a classic North Indian dish that embodies comfort and richness. 
                    It is a creamy and buttery lentil preparation made with black lentils (urad dal) and kidney beans (rajma), 
                    slow-cooked with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The lentils are simmered for hours until they become soft and creamy, and the flavors meld together. 
                    The addition of cream and butter towards the end gives it a luscious and velvety texture.
                     Dal Makhani is often enjoyed with naan or rice, and its indulgent taste makes it a favorite at special occasions and restaurants.
